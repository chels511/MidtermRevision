				<h1>NIGERIA<a href = "https://panaramiconline.com/"><img id="flags"src="nigeria.webp"></a></h1>
				<p>One of the earliest Nigerian made comic books was Wale Adenuga’s Ikebe Super and Super Story — which was a big deal in the 70s and 80s. The advent of Supa Strikas in 2001 ushered in a refined version of Nigerian comics.</p>
				<p>The Nigerian comic book industry faced challenges during the late 1990s and early 2000s, with a decline in printed comics due to economic factors and a shift toward digital entertainment. However, in the 2000s, there was a resurgence in Nigerian comics, largely fueled by a new generation of creators who embraced digital media, webcomics, and social media platforms. Creators like Akinola Davis Jr. ("Kala") and Jide Martin ("CelestialVibe") began to gain recognition. The emergence of platforms like "Comic Republic" and "YouNeek Studios" has been instrumental in promoting Nigerian comics and graphic novels, featuring characters like "Guardian Prime" and "Malika: Warrior Queen.</p>

				<h1>SOUTH AFRICA<a href = "https://www.afropolitancomics.com/en"><img id="flags"src="southafrica.png"></a></h1>
                 <p>Comics in South Africa have a long history, dating back to the early 20th century, with the emergence of humor strips and political cartoons in local newspapers. However, the medium truly came into its own during the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century. Pioneering artists and writers began producing comics that addressed a wide range of themes, including apartheid, social justice, folklore, and everyday life. These comics became a potent tool for cultural preservation and political commentary. Despite the challenges of censorship during apartheid, the industry continued to thrive, with the emergence of local publishing houses, comic conventions, and an array of diverse voices. South African comics have gained international recognition, blending traditional storytelling elements with modern styles to create unique and engaging narratives. </p>

				<h1>UGANDA<a href = "https://startjournal.org/2012/07/chris-mugarura-the-present-and-future-of-ugandan-comics-industry/"><img id="flags"src="ugflag.svg"></a></h1>
				<p>The history of comics in Uganda is a relatively recent but rapidly growing phenomenon. Comics as a form of storytelling and art have gained prominence in Uganda over the past few decades. While the country does not have an extensive tradition of comic book creation dating back centuries, it has embraced this visual medium as a powerful means of storytelling and expression in the modern era. The growth of Ugandan comics can be attributed to the increasing interest in visual arts, the influence of global pop culture, and the desire to share and preserve Ugandan stories. As technology and connectivity have advanced, Ugandan comic creators have found new opportunities to share their work with a broader audience, both domestically and internationally. </p>
