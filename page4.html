				<p>Known as Bandes dessinees, Franco-Belgian comics are considered one of the big three of the global comics industry.In Europe, French is spoken natively not only in France and the city state of Monaco, but also by significant portions of the population of Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. The shared language creates an artistic and commercial market where national identity is often blurred, and one of the main rationales for the conception of the "Franco-Belgian comics" expression itself. </p>
				<p>In the 1920s, after the end of the first world war, the French artist Alain Saint-Ogan started out as a professional cartoonist, creating the successful series Zig et Puce in 1925. Saint-Ogan was one of the first French-speaking artists to fully utilize techniques popularized and formularized in the United States, such as Speech balloons, even though the text comic format would remain the predominant native format for the next two to three decades in France, propagated as such by France's educators.</p>
				<p>Before the Second World War, comics were almost exclusively published in tabloid newspapers. Since 1945, the "comic album" (or "comics album", in French "album BD" for short) format gained popularity, a book-like format about half the former size. The albums, usually colored all the way through, are almost always hardcover for the French editions and softcover for the Dutch editions.</p>

				<h1>ITALY<a href = "https://www.europecomics.com/history-italian-comics-part-1/"><img id = "flags" src="italyflag.png"></a></h1>
                 <p>Known as Fumetto, which refers to the distinctive word balloons that contain the dialogue in comics, Italian fumetto has its roots in periodicals aimed at younger readers and in the satirical publications of the 19th century. These magazines published cartoons and illustrations for educational and propagandist purposes. The first illustrated satirical publication appeared in 1848, in L'Arlecchino, a daily paper published in Naples. Other noteworthy examples of satirical papers of the period include Lo Spirito Folletto published in Milan, Turin's Il Fischietto and Il Fanfulla, established in Rome in 1872.</p>
                 <p>On December 27, 1908, the first mainstream publication primarily for comics, Il Corriere dei Piccoli, appeared on Italian newstands. The first issue introduced readers to the adventures of Bilbolbul by Attilio Mussino, featuring what is considered to be the first Italian comic character.</p>
                 <p>Italy also produces many Disney comics, i.e., stories featuring Disney characters (from Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes). </p>

			     <h1>SPAIN<a href = "https://www.europecomics.com/history-comics-spain-part-1/"><img id="flags"src="spainflag.webp"></a></h1>
			     <p>Known as historietas, with tebeos primarily denoting the magazines containing the medium, It has been stated that the 13th century Cantigas de Santa Maria could be considered as the first Spanish "comic", although comics made their official debut around 1857 at the Spanish colonies. Among the first comic magazines in peninsular Spain were the satirical La Flaca (1869-1876) or El Mundo Comico (1873). After them, TBO was specially influential in popularizing the medium.</p>
			     <p>After the Spanish Civil War the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media, and comics were no exception. As part of this ban, superhero comics were forbidden by the Francoist regime; as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (influenced by Foster's Prince Valiant). Despite Franco's controls, the 1940s and 1950s are considered a golden age of Spanish comics, and many titles were at the height of their popularity.</p>
			     <p>Spanish comics fell on hard times during the 90s and 2000s due to market saturation and alot of magazines ceased production. Since 2007, a National Comic Award which revitalized the medium was established by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. </p>

				<h1>POLAND<a href = "https://culture.pl/en/article/a-foreigners-guide-to-polish-comics"><img id="flags"id="flags"src="polflag.png"></a></h1>
				<p>One of the first and most famous Polish comics was Kozio≈Çek Matolek (Matolek the Billy-Goat), created by Kornel Makuszynski (story) and Marian Walentynowicz (art) in 1933. It became a cult classic, still popular today, and is an important part of the canon of Polish children's literature. In the People's Republic of Poland the term comic (komiks) was discouraged as a "demoralising Western influence," and the terms "graphic stories" (historyjki obrazkowe) or "color books" (kolorowe zeszyty) were preferred instead; they were actually illegal and forbidden from 1947 to 1957. In modern Poland those terms have largely been forgotten, and the formerly discouraged English loanword "comics" (Polish "komiks") is now the main term for the medium. </p>
				<p>One of the most notable series created in 1957 (and concluded in 2009) was Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek, which became the longest-published and one of the most popular Polish comic book series. </p>
				<p>Over the past few years, the market for comics in Poland has grown rapidly; there is an increasing number of Polish comic books and magazines. Japanese manga has been introduced, and the first Polish manga-style publications have appeared. As throughout the world, webcomics have also become increasingly popular. </p>

				<h1>SERBIA<a href = "https://www.europecomics.com/short-history-comics-serbia-part-1/"><img id="flags"src="serbflag.webp"></a></h1>
				<p>Known as stripovi, Serbia has influence from American and French comics. In 1932 Merry Thursday, an illustrated magazine for children, appeared in Belgrade; an unusually large amount of space was allotted to cartoons. The magazine featured foreign works such as The Katzenjammer Kids and Felix the Cat, but also The Adventures of Mika the Mouse, a Mickey Mouse pastiche by Serbian authors. In addition to adventure comics, Walt Disney's cartoon animals were also popular at the time, especially Mickey Mouse, whose name would be used in the titles of a number of Yugoslav comic publications </p>
				<p>In 1935, inspired by the adventures of Alex Raymond's X-9, Vlastimir Belkic created the first original character in Serbian comics named Hari Vils. Most of the Golden Age artists were Russian immigrants, collectively known as the Belgrade Circle and gathered at first around the Mika Mis magazine. </p>
				<p>As of 2018, the best-selling graphic novel in recent history has been Sat, a WW1 story written by Dragan Lazarevic De Lazare and drawn by Vujadin Radovanovic Vuja with colors by Rade Tovladijac; it was distributed in 120,000 copies via daily Vecernje novosti to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Serbian comics have branched out to many forms of media such as video games and movies.</p>
